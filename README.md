# AE502_hw2
This repo contains the files code.py and utils.py (utilities for code.py) to time integrate Gauss's Planetary Equations from Curtis (2014) Ch12.

# utils.py
This file contains the function "solve_kepler" to solve the kepler equation for the eccentric anomaly given the mean anomaly and eccentricity. 

# code.py
This file contains the function "odes" to define the Gauss's Planetary equations. Scipy's "odeint" is used to carry out the integration
